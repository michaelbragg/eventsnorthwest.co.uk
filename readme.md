### Testing Your Changes

Our test suite is run on every commit pushed to this repository.

### Updating WordPress and Plugins

To upgrade to the latest PATCH versions of WordPress or its plugins re-provision Vagrant by running `vagrant provision` from your command line.

Upgrading to a MAJOR or MINOR version you will need to manually update `require` and `require-dev` sections of the `composer.json` file and re-provision Vagrant by running `vagrant provision` from your command line.

After testing the new version(s) commit the updated `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files back the the repository for deployment.

### Making Your Changes

Make your changes locally on a new branch based off `origin/master`. Push your changes to this repository to perform our tests.

### Deploying to our Staging Server

Once our tests are passed, create a pull request to merge into our `develop` branch. After approval and merging this will be deployed to our staging server.

### Deploying to our Live Server

If you are happy with your changes. Create a pull request to merge your original branch into `master` (not `develop`). On merge this will start the deployment process to our live server.

## Documentation

During the Alpha/Beta stages, due to constant changes, documentation will be mainly written in-line. With a dedicated section being created at the first major release.

- In order not to expose sensitive files in the webroot, we move what's required into a `html/` directory including the vendor'd `wp/` source, and the `wp-content` source.
- `wp-content` has been named `app` to better reflect its contents. It contains application code and not just "static content". It also matches up with other frameworks such as Symfony and Rails.
- `wp-config.php` remains in the `web/` because it's required by WordPress, but it only acts as a loader. The actual configuration files have been moved to `config/` for better separation.
- `vendor/` is where the Composer managed dependencies are installed to.
- `wp/` is where the WordPress core lives. It's also managed by Composer but can't be put under `vendor` due to WP limitations.
- `uploads` has been named `media` and moved outside the `app` folder to better separate code and "static" content.
- `scripts/` hold the bash scripts used for setting up and running tasks on the environment.
